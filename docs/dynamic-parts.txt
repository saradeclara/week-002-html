- Number next to "Things to do"
- Content of Tag list table (new elements to be added dynamically from the input text field into new row of main table)

Potential Issues:
- Duplicated items
- Long list difficult to organise/scan through (add categories when adding new item)
- Keeping completed tasks (for a week? a month?) before deleting them permanently
- Set Undo button if task was deleted by mistake

New Potential Features:
- Set recurring tasks (ie. add "check emails" tasks every Monday at 9am)
- Add speech-to-text function (speech recognition API only supported by Chrome and Opera https://caniuse.com/#search=speech%20recognition)
- Drag-and-drop functionality
